## The microphone üé§

**1. Headphones or external microphones**
* If you have headphones with incorporated microphones, use them. 
* If you use this option, please do not grab the mic. 
* Let it fall naturally  ‚Äî without excessively rubbing against your clothes/hair.
* Whichever microphone you use you need to keep one thing in mind: Direct the microphone towards your throat, not your mouth. Microphones pick up the sounds coming from your throat, instead of your mouth and lips. This is the reason why lapel microphones are placed on lapels and pointed towards your throat, never your mouth.  

**2. Without headphones**
* If you don‚Äôt have headphones, you will have to use the one from your laptop. So make sure you are not moving objects on the table and that your computer doesn‚Äôt have the funs at a very high speed. 

## Location, location and location üè†

| AVOID | LOOK FOR |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
|Small, box rooms. Your bathroom is the wrong place to record voice | Cosy spaces with soft furnishings: pillows, chairs, sofas... These prevent echoes and unpleasant background noises. |
| Moving objects on the table | Sitting down far away from walls. The closer to the middle of the room, the better. |
| Unfurnished rooms | |
| Sitting down next to walls | |
| Opening windows | |
| Any constant background noise: air conditioner, fans, trains, traffic‚Ä¶ | |

`Tip: Clap a couple of times and listen. Do you notice some echo? If you do, move somewhere else.`

## Your tone and speed :lips:

Stay calm and pause. Often, we tend to talk as fast as possible, especially when talking about a topic we are enthusiastic or nervous about. 

* **Pauses are good**, they are a friendly, useful tool we should use constantly. They can give that needed emphasis to a specific word or statement. They build expectation or make the listener pay attention to what comes next. 
* **Talk slow.** When you read some text that you know by heart, often you read it faster. Bear in mind that for the person that hears it for the first time, he/she will need a little extra.  Keep your speed constant and slow, but strong. 
* **Try to use your natural tone**, as you would do in a normal conversation. If you are excited, show it with your tone. If you are serious about important facts, demonstrate them with your voice. In explanatory videos, facial expressions are completely lost, so the tone of your voice directs the entire message.  
* **Videos should never be a boring** Q&A session/seminar. People often want to hear real conversations, so don‚Äôt forget to enjoy them and create a relaxed and fun atmosphere. 

## Practise and listen :ear: 

We often hate to hear ourselves on a recording, but this step is vital to ensure a good video. We are not looking for a professional production video, and we don‚Äôt expect you to build a BBC top audio recording, but we need to make sure the audio is accessible and understandable. 

So, test your first recording before continuing with all your videos:

* Do you hear loud background noise? 
* Does your microphone rub against your clothes (if you use one)? 
* Is your voice loud and clear? 
* Are you speaking at a good pace but not too fast?
